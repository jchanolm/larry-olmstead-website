            <h3>Leadership Team Realignment</h3>
            <p>Sometimes executive teams lose their way, giving into "me" vs. "we" behavior that creates unhealthy conflict and distracts from core mission and strategies. Larry has worked with such teams at a major newspaper in New Jersey, a leading non-profit in San Jose, CA, and other locations to identify and address core stress points.</p>
            <p>The process involves individual and team coaching to get people refocused on core mission, establishing clear communication protocols, and building collaborative decision-making processes that serve the organization's goals.</p>
            <p>Teams that complete this process report improved collaboration, clearer accountability, and renewed focus on their mission-critical work.</p>
